                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
                    It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment 
                    (for<br>example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the 
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, 
                        Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as 
                        operators,<br> control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
                        be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with 
                        additional objects; for example:
                    </p>
                    
                    <ul>
                     <li>
                    <p>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control 
                        a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).<br>
                        For example, client-side extensions allow an application to 
                        place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as<br>
                        mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </p>
                     </li> 
                     <li>
                    <p>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant 
                        to running JavaScript on a server. For example,<br> 
                        server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, 
                        provide continuity of information from one invocation to <br>
                         another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server
                    </p>
                     </li>
                    </ul>

                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
                     in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does <br>
                     not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                      follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic <br>
                      control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, 
                    JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of <br>
                    data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has 
                    a prototype-based object model instead of the more common <br>
                    class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; 
                    that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. <br>
                    JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions
                     can be properties of objects, executing as loosely <br>
                     typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have
                     to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have <br>
                     to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected,
                      and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters,<br>
                      and function return types are not explicitly typed.
